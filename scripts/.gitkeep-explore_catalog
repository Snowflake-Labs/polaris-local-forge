# Note: explore_catalog.sql is generated

The `explore_catalog.sql` file is auto-generated during `task catalog:setup` 
from the Jinja2 template at:
  polaris-forge-setup/templates/scripts/explore_catalog.sql.j2

It will contain pre-configured credentials and endpoints for your environment.

Run `task catalog:setup` to generate it.
